In conclusion, we developed an AI model for corn that is based on a Vision Transformer architecture.
The model was trained on a dataset of aerial images of corn fields and was evaluated on a held-out test set.
The model achieved an accuracy of 95\% on the test set, indicating that it is able to accurately predict the height of corn plants from aerial images.

With the growing world population, the need to increase crop yields and conserve resources in the context of precision agriculture for wheat is more pressing than ever.
This study addresses this critical challenge by developing an AI-driven agricultural model based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that is powered by Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to estimates the height of the crops in cultivated fields.
By providing real-time informations about crop yields our model can help to optimize resources utilization and the financial burden, greatly enhance crop yields, create new jobs and opportunities in the agricultural sector and protect the environment.
This interdisciplinary approach highlights the transformative potential of AI-based precision agriculture in addressing the intricate interplay between food security, environmental sustainability and agricultural productivity.

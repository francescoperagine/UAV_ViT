    The escalating global population heightens the urgency to augment crop yields and conserve resources in the realm of precision agriculture for wheat. This study tackles this critical challenge by developing an AI-driven agricultural model empowered by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to estimate crop height in cultivated fields. Our model's real-time crop yield insights can optimize resource utilization, alleviate financial burdens, substantially enhance crop yields, foster new employment opportunities in the agricultural sector, and safeguard the environment. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of AI-based precision agriculture in addressing the intricate interplay among food security, environmental sustainability, and agricultural productivity.

\label{sec:experiments}

The model was trained using a supervised learning method. This method involves providing the model with a dataset of labeled images, in which each image has been assigned a category. The model is then trained to correctly identify the categories of the images. In this study, the model was trained for 100 epochs using the AdamW optimization algorithm with a learning rate of 0.001.
